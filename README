Hello, I am @dileep98490This is a two pass Macro-processor for IBM-360. It was a computer of IBM in the 60's. Read J.J.Donovan's book on System's Programming for more infoThe ALA.DIL, ALA2.DIL, MDT.DIL are the binary files that help the Macro_Processor.cThe Input.txt is the actual input that we give. In the first pass it creates a Input2.txt stripping down the macro definetions and in the second pass it creates Output.txt replacing the macros with the corresponding definetions. The rest were object files of the corresponding C-codes
